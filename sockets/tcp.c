class: cs224
class time: 11am MWF

An library to abstract the C sockets interface from the programmer.  This
file implements the TCP protocol.  Although everything is well documented,
you can start by looking at inittcp() and opentcp().   


bugs:
    the cons socket descriptor table is not reused.  After 50 unique client
    or server connections (bindings only), you will run out of connections to
    create.  A linked list or similar structure could fix this problem.  A loop
    to recycle items in the array since they are marked (-1) would work as well.

    Note this does not prevent a server process from getting 50+ connections
    to it since accept() calls are not affected.

    inittcp

    Sets up the tcp socket library.  Must be called 1 time before
    using any other functions.  (may be used to setup a linked list
    or other structure in the future to replace cons array!)

    tcp sockets can be created.

/*
    opentcp

    Creates a new TCP connection for client or server communications.

    Must be called after inittcp has been called once and before any other
    function in the tcp sockets lib.

    PRECONDITIONS:
    Need to create a tcp connection.
    @param server   should this be a server socket?
    @param address  an ip address, DNS name or hostname (www.yahoo.com, etc)
                    for server use, must be localhost, 0.0.0.0, an interface
                    on the server to bind to like say 192.168.0.1 or a hostname
                    for said interface.
    @param port     the port to connect to or bind to (client/server)

    POSTCONDITIONS:
    @returns a "socket descriptor" for the newly created connection.

    A socket descriptor is a index value that represents a connection, thus
    allowing any app that uses this library to create multiple concurrent 
    connections.  (Not thread safe though)  socket descriptor was invented for 
    this library.  Esseintally its similar to the idea of a file descriptor
    for the open() system call.  Each one corresponds to a table in this file.
